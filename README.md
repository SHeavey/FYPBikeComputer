# Project Description
The outcome of this project is a multi-functional bike computer that calculates data to which a cyclist would want to have real-time access.  This project is geared towards professional cyclists and people who take cycling seriously.  During the research phase, numerous avid cyclists were asked their opinions, with the consensus being that everyone would enjoy having access to real-time statistics while cycling.

The scope of the project begins with collecting data, such as current, average, and maximum speed, distance, and revolutions per minute (RPM).  It then transmits data from a sensor to an MQTT broker for storage, where a user-friendly website and Android application that subscribe to the data display it in real-time.

The project reached its goal of developing a fully functional module for cyclists.  The project was challenging and presented numerous learning opportunities.  Some of the learning opportunities include the use of new hardware and programming languages, including, but not limited to, Python, Java, and JavaScript, Node, Express, jQuery, chart.js, and Ajax.

# Hardware Requirements

I will use a Raspberry Pi to power my project with a Hall Effect Sensor attached to a bike that will measure the following: 
•	Current/Maximum/Average speed
•	Distance
•	RPM

# Software Programmes Languages to be used
Python
Java
JavaScript
# Measurements/Calculations for Stats on bike
Python + MQTT
# Android App    
MySQL, Android Studio, Java
# Web page & Server
Amazon Web Services (AWS), MongoDB, JavaScript, NODEJS, PuTTY, WINSCP
