# Project Description
Viewing real time statistics while riding is extremely important for professional riders and people who take cycling seriously. My final year project will be an interactive bike computer. Data such as current/maximum/average speed, cadence, distance, temperature and the trip ride time will be measured. This data will be displayed real time, on an Android application that will be mounted to the front of the bike. Cyclists will have the option to share their journey to a webpage. This user-friendly webpage will store data from all shared journeys. Graphs will also be available on the webpage. A heart rate module will be placed on the handle bars. This will allow the user to be aware of how much there body is working at different stages of the cycle. LEDs will flash when the cyclist goes over a certain heart rate to let them know that there body is working harder than it should be. Overall, the aim of this project is to assist and improve the performance of people who take cycling seriously.

# Hardware Requirements

I will use a Raspberry Pi to power my project with two Hall Effect Sensors attached to a bike that will measure the following: 
•	Current/Maximum/Average speed
•	Cadence
•	Distance
•	Ride time
A temperature sensor module will be used. A GPS module will be used to remind the cyclist where the journey was when looking back on previous journeys on the webpage. A heart rate module will signal the cyclist how much there body is working. LEDs will also flash when the cyclist goes over a certain heart rate and the speed limit of the road.
